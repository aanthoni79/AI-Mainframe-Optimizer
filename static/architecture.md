# AI Mainframe Optimizer - Application Architecture

## Overview
The AI Mainframe Optimizer is a Streamlit application designed to analyze mainframe job data (SMF-like logs) to identify optimization opportunities and provide recommendations for reducing MSU usage and costs.

## Core Components

### 1. Data Processing Layer
- **CSV Parser**: Handles the upload and parsing of SMF-like log data
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and transforms the data for analysis
- **Pandas Integration**: Performs data manipulation and aggregation

### 2. Analysis Layer
- **MSU Usage Analyzer**: Identifies high MSU-consuming jobs and time windows
- **Peak Detection**: Detects spiky time windows with MSU overload
- **Job Pattern Analyzer**: Analyzes job execution patterns and dependencies

### 3. AI/ML Layer
- **NLP Component**: Generates natural language performance summaries (will integrate with GPT-4 later)
- **Forecasting Engine**: Predicts future MSU usage using Prophet or scikit-learn
- **Recommendation Engine**: Suggests job rescheduling and other optimization strategies

### 4. Visualization Layer
- **Interactive Charts**: Displays MSU usage over time, job distributions, etc.
- **Heatmaps**: Shows peak usage times and optimization opportunities
- **Comparison Views**: Compares original vs. optimized schedules

### 5. User Interface (Streamlit)
- **Data Upload**: Interface for uploading CSV data
- **Dashboard**: Main view with key metrics and visualizations
- **Recommendation Panel**: Displays AI-generated recommendations
- **Savings Calculator**: Shows estimated cost savings from optimizations

## Data Flow

1. User uploads CSV data through the Streamlit interface
2. Data is processed and analyzed to extract key metrics
3. Analysis results are displayed in the dashboard
4. AI components generate recommendations and forecasts
5. User can interact with visualizations and explore optimization scenarios
6. Savings calculator estimates the impact of proposed optimizations

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Backend Processing**: Python, Pandas, NumPy
- **AI/ML**: Prophet for forecasting, placeholder for GPT-4 integration
- **Visualization**: Plotly, Matplotlib, Streamlit native charts

## Prioritized Features (Business Value Focus)

1. **MSU Usage Analysis**: Identify top MSU-consuming jobs and time periods
2. **Peak Detection**: Highlight time windows with MSU overload
3. **Optimization Recommendations**: Suggest job rescheduling to reduce peak MSU usage
4. **Savings Calculator**: Estimate cost savings from implementing recommendations
5. **Performance Summary**: Generate natural language summaries of performance trends
6. **MSU Forecasting**: Predict future MSU usage patterns

## Implementation Approach

The application will be developed in phases, focusing first on the core features that provide the most business value:

1. **Phase 1**: Data upload, basic analysis, and visualization
2. **Phase 2**: Peak detection and optimization recommendations
3. **Phase 3**: Savings calculator and performance summaries
4. **Phase 4**: Forecasting and advanced features

This phased approach ensures that the most valuable features are delivered first, with additional capabilities added incrementally.
